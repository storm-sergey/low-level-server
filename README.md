This is my study implementation of a simple echo-server.
-----------
### For what
Familiarity with the low-level WEB already allows me to better understand the reasons for the failure of the Node.js or Express.js server. This saves time when troubleshooting errors.

### To use
on the server:
```
./low-level-server localhost 80
```

on the client:
```
telnet localhost 80
```
```
"Message"
```
